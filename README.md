# Knowledge Auditor API 🚧

> **Status:** Work in Progress (WIP)

## Overview
The **Knowledge Auditor API** is an ASP.NET Core service designed to support **Responsible AI** by auditing AI-generated responses against **company knowledge, policies, and risk rules**.

Instead of focusing on model accuracy, this project focuses on **governance, enforcement, and explainability**:
- Was the response grounded in approved knowledge?
- Which policy or document supports the decision?
- Should the response be approved, rejected, or escalated?

---

## Goals
- Enforce **evidence-based AI responses**
- Support **auditability and traceability**
- Apply **company-specific policies and rules**
- Enable **risk-aware decision making**
- Demonstrate practical **Responsible AI engineering**

---

## What This Project Is
- ✅ A governance and audit layer for AI systems  
- ✅ An example of Responsible AI enforcement  
- ✅ A backend API focused on trust and control  

## What This Project Is NOT
- ❌ A chatbot UI  
- ❌ A model training project  
- ❌ A prompt-only solution  

---

## Current Scope (Phase 1)
- Single-company knowledge base (HR policies)
- In-memory knowledge loading
- Policy-aware audit decisions
- Clear audit outcomes (approve / reject / escalate)

---

## Planned Work
- Governance pipeline implementation
- Knowledge retrieval service
- Evaluation and decision logic
- API endpoints for auditing
- Tests for audit and refusal scenarios
- Documentation and architecture notes

---

## Tech Stack
- ASP.NET Core (.NET)
- C#
- Git & GitHub
- Evaluation-driven decision logic

---

## Status
🚧 **This repository is under active development.**  
The structure and foundations are in place, but features are being implemented incrementally.

---

## Motivation
This project is built to gain hands-on experience with:
- Responsible AI
- AI governance systems
- Auditability and compliance-aware design
- Enterprise-grade backend architecture
